# Early-ChatBot-Data-Modeling
This is a project I developed for a healthcare corp with real patient data. I was required to provide a summarization and visualization for their executives. I also demonstrated a simple use case of using gpt3.5 to query/search/interact with the corp's database. Note that due to NDA constraints the files are a very simple version/demo for the entire project. 

## ChatBot

Based on the input the chatbot received, the algo could query the required information from the database containing 30+ tables. Such information needed could be name, DoB, SSN, patient history, etc. It also featured some level of prompt engineering (there are dozens of prompts we adopted eventually, but the one here serves as a nice demo).
